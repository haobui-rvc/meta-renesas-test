Subject: [PATCH 141/628] usb: host: xhci: add a new quirk
 XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT

On some xHCI controllers (e.g. R-Car SoCs), the AC64 bit (bit 0) of
HCCPARAMS1 is set to 1. However, the xHCs don't support 64-bit
address memory pointers actually. So, in this case, this driver should
call dma_set_coherent_mask(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(32)) in xhci_gen_setup().
Otherwise, the xHCI controller will be died after a usb device is
connected if it runs on above 4GB physical memory environment.

So, this patch adds a new quirk XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT to resolve
such an issue.
