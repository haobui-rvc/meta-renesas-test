Subject: [PATCH 372/628] ARM: DTS: r8a7744-iwg20m: Sound DMA support via SRC

DMA transfer to/from SRC

     DMA      DMApp
[MEM] -> [SRC] -> [SSIU] -> [SSI]

     DMA      DMApp
[MEM] <- [SRC] <- [SSIU] <- [SSI]

Current sound driver is supporting
SSI/SRC random connection.
So, this patch is tring
SSI0 -> SRC0
SSI1 <- SRC1
